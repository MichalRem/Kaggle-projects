# Kaggle projects
Repository contains Kaggle projects developed in Python. I completed the projects to improve my data related skills and gain more experience. 
- If you would like to chat with me about the portfolio, work opportunities, or collaboration please contact me via e-mail: michal.rembelski@gmail.com.
- Please, notice that sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, in that case copy and paste link to the project you would like to see in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ website

- **[Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://github.com/MichalRem/Kaggle-projects/blob/master/Santander%20Customer%20Transaction%20Prediction/Santander%20Customer%20Transaction%20Prediction.ipynb)** - Santander works on improving their machine learning algorithms to solve their most common challenges (binary classification problems) and find the answers for such questions as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?

  In this project Santander invite Kagglers to help answer the question: which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. Thus the goal is to create a model that will hep to make a binary prediction of the target variable.
